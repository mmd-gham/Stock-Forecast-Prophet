# Stock Price Forecasting with Neural Networks and Bollinger Bands
This project explores the use of neural networks to predict the future price of Google stock (GOOG). The model leverages the power of the NeuralProphet library, designed specifically for time series forecasting, to capture complex patterns in stock price data.

Key Features:

* Stationarity: The data is preprocessed to achieve stationarity, ensuring that the model learns from the inherent fluctuations of the stock price without being biased by trends or seasonality.
* NeuralProphet: NeuralProphet is employed to build and train a neural network model, capable of identifying intricate patterns within the time series data.
* Bollinger Bands: Bollinger Bands are incorporated into the model's output, providing a visual representation of potential price volatility. This enhances the predictions by giving insights into the range of possible future prices.

Impact:

This project aims to provide a valuable tool for investors and traders interested in Google stock. The model's predictions and the visualization of volatility provided by Bollinger Bands can support informed decision-making in financial markets.

Future Work:

* Explore the incorporation of additional features, such as economic indicators, market sentiment, or technical indicators, to further enhance the model's predictive power.
* Implement backtesting and model evaluation techniques to assess the model's performance and accuracy.
* Consider incorporating other neural network architectures like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to handle complex time series data.

This project showcases the potential of neural networks in financial forecasting and offers a solid foundation for further exploration and development.
